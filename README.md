In this project, we analyse, apply and review the methodologies used in a paper published by Lyons, Nejad and Arribas on pricing exotic derivatives. 
By applying theoretical results on the approximation of derivative payoffs using signature payoffs, the implied market signature is estimated using a restricted class of derivatives and their market prices. 
This is then applied to a wider class of derivatives to obtain price estimates.
